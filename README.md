# moveit

moveit is an application developed during RocketSeat's Next Level Week (Feb, 2021).
It provides simple physical exercises to be performed once at every 25 minutes cycle,
and is meant for people who spends a lot of time in front of the computer.

To make things more interesting, it has a gamification aspect, where XP points are earned
every time a challenge is completed. By earning XP points, a user can start reaching new
levels.
